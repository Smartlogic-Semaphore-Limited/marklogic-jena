# marklogic-jena v1.0.0

## Introduction

This library integrates MarkLogic Semantics feature into the [Jena RDF
Framework](http://jena.apache.org) as a persistence and query layer.

### Before you start

#### Setup Marklogic

Ensure MarkLogic 8.0-4 is installed and running.  To use `marklogic-jena`
applications you will need access to a running MarkLogic server.

## Usage

### Quick start

This API is distributed on Maven Central.

For gradle-based projects include this dependency in `build.gradle`
```
dependencies {
   compile 'com.marklogic:marklogic-jena:1.0.0'
